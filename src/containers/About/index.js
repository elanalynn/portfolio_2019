      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>
        I make software. I’m not tied to any particular technology, but I have experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, AngularJS, Angular, React, Node, RAILS, and a bit of Elixir. I also have a background in design, UX, and marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from development and design, I like community building. While teaching, I launched a women’s Meetup on two campuses, a mentorship program, and an Instructor Lunch n’ Learn program. I’ve given several talks at Meetups in the Denver area and I’m always open to volunteer opportunities.

        I also enjoy writing, reading, hiking, skiing, and yoga. I care a lot about animals (shifting our perspectives towards them and improving their lives), and education for everyone.
