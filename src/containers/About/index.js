      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>
        I make software. I have experience with JavaScript (TypeScript, AngularJS, Angular, React, and Node), Python and RAILS. I also have a background in design, UX, and marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from development and design, I like learning, teaching, and community building. While I was an Instructor at Galvanize, I launched a women in tech meetup on two campuses, a mentorship program, and a lunch n’ learn program. In my current role at Guild Education, I have managed a Diversity & Inclusion committee. I’ve presented a few talks at meetups and I’m always open to volunteer opportunities.

        Outside of work, I enjoy drawing, writing, reading, hiking, skiing, and yoga. I am passionate about giving animals a voice, protecting them from harm, and shifting our perspectives towards them. I also care deeply about developing equitable education for everyone.
